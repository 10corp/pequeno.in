I passed my RHCE for RHEL 6 today!

* [RHCSA verification](https://www.redhat.com/wapps/training/certification/verify.html?certNumber=140-090-945&isSearch=False&verify=Verify "its legit")

* [RHCE verification](https://www.redhat.com/wapps/training/certification/verify.html?certNumber=140-179-292&isSearch=False&verify=Verify "also totes 4 real")

As awesome as that is, I get to do the whole thing over again with RHEL 7 to actually begin to work towards my RHCA. My joy knows no bounds.
