# Network Services

This is the second in a three part series covering the objectives for the Red Hat Certified Engineer (RCHE, EX300) exam.

# Install the packages <a name="obj1"></a>

The full objective is: _Install the packages needed to provide the service._

This seems like a very generic objective. I'll outline a general approach to installing the packages and ensuring they are started on boot. These steps will be simliar for any service you wish to install on a given system.

    [root@netserv ~]# yum search ntp
    [root@netserv ~]# yum install ntp
    
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl list-unit-files | grep ntp
    ntpd.service                              disabled
    ntpdate.service                           disabled     
    
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl enable ntpd.service 
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ntpd.service'
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl start ntpd.service 

    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl list-unit-files | grep ntp
    ntpd.service                              enabled 
    ntpdate.service                           disabled

# Configure SELinux to support the service <a name="obj2"></a>

Everybody's favorite thing in the world, SELinux.  First, let's make sure it's on and doing its thing:

    [root@netserv ~]# getenforce
    Permissive

We need to change it to `Enforcing` so we'll edit the SELinux config file to make sure we boot into `Enforcing` and we'll use `setenforce 1` to make SELinux enforce rules during this session:

    [root@netserv ~]# vim /etc/selinux/config 
    SELINUX=enforcing
    [root@netserv ~]# setenforce 1

Rather than put all the particular SELinux configurations here, I'll note any needed configs in the section that pertains to that service.

# Use SELinux port labeling to allow services to use non-standard ports <a name="obj3"></a>

See above

# Configure the service to start when the system is booted <a name="obj4"></a>

See the [first section](obj1)

# Configure the service for basic operation <a name="obj5"></a>

Typically Red Hat only expects you to have the service installed and running with very little configuration. "Basic operation" also implies that the service should not be blocked by SELinux or firewall rules to be sure to understand all the aspects of what makes the service function.

# Configure host-based and user-based security for the service <a name="obj6"></a>

RHEL 7, as with previous versions can use either firewalls or [TCP Wrapper][2] to configure host-based security. Some services like SMB and HTTPD can make restrictions based on users. This objective basically means that you should be aware of the various ways that you can restrict the given service.

# HTTP/HTTPS <a name="obj7"></a>

This objective covers the [Apache][3] web server. Fortunaly there isn't much difference in how apache operates from RHEL 6. An important thing to be aware of is the major version has changed to httpd 2.4.x in RHEL 7. 

    [root@netserv ~]# httpd -v
    Server version: Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS)
    Server built:   Jul 23 2014 14:48:00

First, lets get it installed. Note that we also install the httpd-manual so we can have reference material available to us when needed:

    [root@netserv ~]# yum install httpd httpd-manual -y
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl enable httpd.service 
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service'
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl start httpd.service 


## Configure a VirtualHost <a name="obj7-1"></a>

I'll be using my domain powertra.in for these examples.

First things first, we should look at the docs that were istalled with `httpd-manual`. In this case I'll go the url http://powertrain/manual The instructions that we need are at the bottom of the middle column of links. We'll be setting up named based VirtualHosts.

With Apache 2.2 we had to use the [NameVirtualHost][4] directive. It looks like that directive no longer has any [effect][5] in Apache 2.4. 

> The NameVirtualHost directive no longer has any effect, other than to emit a warning. Any address/port combination appearing in multiple virtual hosts is implicitly treated as a name-based virtual host. 

Good news for us since this is less work. We can get straight to making our VirtualHost configuration files:

    [root@netserv ~]# cd /etc/httpd/conf.d/
    [root@netserv conf.d]# cat powertra.in.conf 
    <VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName powertra.in
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in
    </VirtualHost>
    
    [root@netserv conf.d]# cat beta.powertra.in.conf 
    <VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName beta.powertra.in
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/beta.powertra.in	
    </VirtualHost>

    [root@netserv conf.d]# cd /var/www/vhosts/

    [root@netserv vhosts]# tree
    .
    ├── beta.powertra.in
    │   └── index.html
    └── powertra.in
        └── index.html
    
    2 directories, 2 files

Each of those index files has a few words to make sure they are distint. I can now go to powertra.in and beta.powertra.in both of which resolve to the same IP address and get different content for each.

## Configure private directories <a name="obj7-2"></a>

By 'private' I believe they mean password protected directories. Again, we'll look to the manual. We are looking for the 'Authentication and Authorization' guide which is at the top of the 3rd column. 

Let's start by creating a directory with some super secret stuff inside:

    [root@netserv powertra.in]# pwd
    /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in
    [root@netserv powertra.in]# mkdir secret
    [root@netserv powertra.in]# cd secret/
    [root@netserv secret]# echo "secret stuff" > index.html

Now we can create (`-c`) a file named `passwords` for apache to check against.

    [root@netserv httpd]# pwd
    /etc/httpd
    [root@netserv httpd]# htpasswd -c passwords steven
    New password: 
    Re-type new password: 
    Adding password for user steven

Now we'll modify the powertra.in configuration file:

    [root@netserv httpd]# cd ../httpd/conf.d/
    [root@netserv conf.d]# vim powertra.in.conf 
    [root@netserv conf.d]# cat powertra.in.conf 
    <VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName powertra.in
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in
    </VirtualHost>
    
    <Directory /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in/secret>
	    AuthType Basic
	    AuthName "SUPER SECRET STUFF HERE"
	    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/passwords
	    Require user steven
    </Directory>

Now, when I try to go to powertra.in/secret I'll be asked to provide my user name `steven` and password.

## Deploy a basic CGI application <a name="obj7-3"></a>

Again, the manual gives us everything we need to complete this objective, this time the link that we're looking for (in my case) is http://powertra.in/manual/howto/cgi.html

Really, this is very simple since apache is already configured the way you need it to be to complete this objective. 

    [root@netserv ~]# cd /var/www/cgi-bin/
    [root@netserv cgi-bin]# ll
    total 4
    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 76 Nov 25 04:04 first.pl
    [root@netserv cgi-bin]# cat first.pl 
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
    print "Hello, World.";

All I did was create a file in `/var/www/cgi-bin/` named `first.pl` and made it executable. From there I can go to powertra.in/cgi-bin/first.pl and see my output, meaning that my CGI "application" has worked.


## Configure group-managed content<a name="obj7-4"></a>

This is essentially the same process we use in setting a password protected directory. This time around we're gonna create a group file which will allow us to use similar setting for a group of users.

First, let's add some users to the `passwords` file we created earlier and then add them to a `groups` file which defines the group name and who belongs to the group. In this case our group will be named `sales`:

    [root@netserv httpd]# pwd
    /etc/httpd
    [root@netserv httpd]# htpasswd passwords tom
    New password: 
    Re-type new password: 
    Adding password for user tom
    [root@netserv httpd]# htpasswd passwords sally
    New password: 
    Re-type new password: 
    Adding password for user sally
    [root@netserv httpd]# htpasswd passwords bill
    New password: 
    Re-type new password: 
    Adding password for user bill
    
    [root@netserv httpd]# vim groups
    [root@netserv httpd]# cat groups 
    sales: tom sally bill


And let's make some content the group should have access to:

    [root@netserv beta.powertra.in]# pwd
    /var/www/vhosts/beta.powertra.in
    [root@netserv beta.powertra.in]# mkdir group
    [root@netserv beta.powertra.in]# echo "group stuff" > group/index.html

And make our directory configuration in the beta.powertra.in conf file:

    [root@netserv conf.d]# pwd
    /etc/httpd/conf.d
    [root@netserv conf.d]# vim beta.powertra.in.conf 
    [root@netserv conf.d]# cat beta.powertra.in.conf 
    <VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName beta.powertra.in
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/beta.powertra.in	
    </VirtualHost>
    
    <Directory /var/www/vhosts/beta.powertra.in/group>
	    AuthType Basic
	    AuthName "GROUP PEEPS ONLY"
	    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/passwords
	    AuthGroupFile /etc/httpd/groups
	    Require group sales
    </Directory>

Now if we try going to beta.powertra.in/group/ we will be asked to provide a user name and password, we can use any that we defined in the `groups` file (`tom`, `sally` or `bill`) but the user `steven` would not be able to get in since he's not a member of the `sales` group.

## Configure TLS security<a name="obj7-5"></a>

For this we'll need to install some extra packages `mod_ssl` will allow apache to use keys and certs. We will have to generate our own self-signed certs for this example. You could use the `openssl` tool but that is too complex for the purposes of this test. The `crypto-utils` package gives us the `genkey` tool which makes generating a key much easier and saves time (in my opinion).

    [root@netserv ~]# yum install mod_ssl crypto-utils -y
    [root@netserv ~]# genkey --days 365 powertra.in

Once we have our keys created we'll have to configure the VirtualHost to use TLS. I have removed the `ssl.conf` file that was provided with `mod_ssl` So I've had to put the `Listen 443 https` directive here. 

A side note: I originally made a cert with a key length of 512 bits, I wasn't able to test this in firefox 33 since keys smaller than 1024 bits are no longer accepted. I was able to test the site with elinks and everything worked from the server side. I made another key with length 2048 and firefox liked that one just fine.

    [root@netserv conf.d]# pwd
    /etc/httpd/conf.d
    [root@netserv conf.d]# cat powertra.in.conf 
    <VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName powertra.in
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in
    </VirtualHost>
    
    <Directory /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in/secret>
	    AuthType Basic
	    AuthName "SUPER SECRET STUFF HERE"
	    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/passwords
	    Require user steven
    </Directory>
    
    Listen 443 https
    
    <VirtualHost *:443>
	    ServerName powertra.in
	    SSLEngine on
	    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/powertra.in.crt
	    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/powertra.in.key
    </VirtualHost>

# DNS <a name="obj8"</a>

Fortunatly, the test doesn't require us to configure a DNS server to any great degree. 
    
## Configure a caching-only name server<a name="obj8-1"></a>

Let me quote Michael Jang from his [book][7]: 

> When configuring a caching-only name server, the first step is to look at the default version of the /etc/named.conf configuration file. The directives in the default version of this file are organized to set up a caching-only nameserver.

There are serveral packages associated with DNS, to simplify things I normally install what is needed this way:

    [root@netserv ~]# yum install bind*
    Installing:
    bind
    bind-chroot
    bind-devel 
    bind-dyndb-ldap 
    bind-lite-devel
    bind-sdb-chroot

Once it's installed we perform the normal steps to "enable" and start the service.

    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl enable named.service 
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/named.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/named.service'
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl start named.service

## Troubleshoot DNS client issues<a name="obj8-1"></a>

Here we should be familiar with how to use the `host`, `dig`, and `nslookup` commands. We should also be familiar with how the DNS system works. Remember to check firewall rules and the `/etc/hosts` file and `/etc/nsswitch.conf` files for any configurations that may cause issues.

# NFS<a name="obj9"></a>

For this section I'll be following along with this [guide][8] from unixmen.com.

## Provide network shares to specific clients<a name="obj9-1"></a>

Let's get NFS installed:

    [root@netserv ~]# yum install nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib -y
    [root@netserv ~]# for i in rpcbind nfs-server nfs-lock nfs-idmap; do systemctl enable $i; done
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/nfs-server.service' '/etc/systemd/system/nfs.target.wants/nfs-server.service'
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/nfs-idmap.service' '/etc/systemd/system/nfs.target.wants/nfs-idmap.service'
    [root@netserv ~]# for i in rpcbind nfs-server nfs-lock nfs-idmap; do systemctl start $i; done
    [root@netserv ~]# mkdir /var/nfs-share
    [root@netserv ~]# chmod 777 /var/nfs-share/
    
Now, I can edit the `/etc/exports` file to specify the host I want to share this resource with. In this example I'm using the IP address of the `tester` host but I could also use a FQDN here as well.

    [root@netserv ~]# vim /etc/exports
    [root@netserv ~]# cat /etc/exports
    /var/nfs-share 166.78.138.141(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl restart nfs-server
    [root@netserv ~]# touch /var/nfs-share/lolfile
    [root@netserv ~]# exportfs -avr
    exporting 166.78.138.141:/var/nfs-share

Now we can go to our client machine and make sure that we can use the remote resource.

    [root@tester ~]# ip a | grep h0$ | awk '{print $2}'
    166.78.138.141/24
    [root@tester ~]# yum install nfs-utils -y
    [root@tester ~]# showmount -e 166.78.138.20
    Export list for 166.78.138.20:
    /var/nfs-share *
    [root@tester ~]# mkdir /my-mount
    [root@tester ~]# mount -t nfs 166.78.138.20:/var/nfs-share /my-mount/
    [root@tester ~]# ls /my-mount/
    lolfile

## Provide network shares suitable for group collaboration<a name="obj9-2"></a>

Certdepot has a good [guide][9] on this objective. In general, we are going to make a directory that is owned by a particular group then export that directory. 

## Use Kerberos to control access to NFS network shares<a name="obj9-3"></a>


# SMB <a name="obj10"></a>

## Provide network shares to specific clients<a name="obj10-1"></a>

## Provide network shares suitable for group collaboration<a name="obj10-2"></a>

## Use Kerberos to authenticate access to shared directories<a name="obj10-3"></a>

# SMTP<a name="obj11"></a>

##Configure a system to forward all email to a central mail server<a name="obj11-1"></a>


# SSH<a name="obj12"></a>

## Configure key-based authentication<a name="obj12-1"></a>

First, I'll generate a keypair on my local machine:

    steven@jupiter ~> ssh-keygen -C steven@pequeno.in
    steven@jupiter ~> ls .ssh/ | grep net
    netserv
    netserv.pub

Now on the server, I'll make the `.ssh` folder which will hold my public key.

    [root@netserv ~]# mkdir .ssh; cd $_
    [root@netserv .ssh]# vim authorized_keys 
    [root@netserv .ssh]# cat authorized_keys 
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCpAhi1SyNRYQno0HB3nxrEn+MANFMAYppRn8LnTd8wD58pii01xW0UwaMPeznXzcpTadM9IwaaShgcCKVNYT6hMtt9gOvGygMUY765i1EnrN0QI1Kzg0mp3bk5CvwHS7I9s2q/Ls1Ly411b64pvZIUQNy9DcjCY9Mui/R4PaoVdo4IyJ7wjiW8PBg56pls+41LV7LkP7xlVUHGMMJQHY2P8wJAbGFYyLEBanClfy+DCJoDD2YudbhpNGN5+6cLnLwREdnqnImymI2gGLdWqP8rQNoLbYNSohlScBWSY47RjyCTTH8Pecw7SiNPAmqeqoOo5pTE3uUDk4lt86NLAiQ1 steven@pequeno.in

And now I can log into the remote machine without a password:

    steven@jupiter ~> ssh root@166.78.138.20
    Last login: Wed Nov 26 00:19:33 2014 from jupiter
    [root@netserv ~]# 

## Configure additional options described in documentation<a name="obj12-2"></a>

There are a lot of various things we can do to configure SSH, but let's discuss making our server more secure.

    [root@netserv ~]# vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
    PermitRootLogin no
    PasswordAuthentication no

We should not allow the `root` account to be accessed locally. By disabling this we can make sure that an attacker does not have an easy target to brute force. 

We should disable password authentication all together. We should also use something like [fail2ban][6] to make sure that an attacker is blocked from making too many failed attempts against the server. But even without fail2ban we can make sure passwords cannot be guessed.

Most ssh configurations will be made in this way. Read the configuration file as most options have explinations.

# NTP<a name="obj13"></a>

## Synchronize time using other NTP peers<a name="obj13-1"></a>

When you install NTP it will come with a set of servers already defined. Normally for practice I will comment those out and use another time server. In this example I'm using one provided by the US Naval Observatory.

    [root@netserv ~]# yum install ntp -y
    server navobs1.wustl.edu
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl enable ntpd.service 
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ntpd.service'
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl start ntpd.service 
    [root@netserv ~]# ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
    ==============================================================================
    *navobs1.wustl.e .GPS.            1 u   37   64    1   31.348   -4.922   0.000
