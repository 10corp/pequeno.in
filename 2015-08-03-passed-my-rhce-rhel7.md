I passed my RHCE for RHEL 7 a few days ago. It's a huge relief to get it out of the way.
The test is no joke. I believe it to be a much different test than the RHEL6 version. The
posts I made earlier are a good place to start but are far short of everything you'll need 
to actually pass. 

I still plan to begin studying for my RHCA. I have a lot of material for the EX236 but I know 
I'll need a lot more. I'm going to take my time though. The scope of all 5 tests is enormous.
