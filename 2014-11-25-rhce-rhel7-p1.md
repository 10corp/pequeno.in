# System Configuration and management

This is the first in a three part series covering the objectives for the Red Hat Certified Engineer (RCHE, EX300) exam.

Each part will follow the objectives as they have been outlined by [Red Hat][1].

* [Use network teaming or bonding to configure aggregated network links between two Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems](#obj1)
* [Configure IPv6 addresses and perform basic IPv6 troubleshooting](#obj2)
* [Route IP traffic and create static routes](#obj3)
* [Use firewalld and associated mechanisms such as rich rules, zones and custom rules, to implement packet filtering and configure network address translation (NAT)](#obj4)
* [Use /proc/sys and sysctl to modify and set kernel runtime parameters](#obj5)
* [Configure a system to authenticate using Kerberos](#obj6)
* [Configure a system as either an iSCSI target or initiator that persistently mounts an iSCSI target](#obj7)
* [Produce and deliver reports on system utilization (processor, memory, disk, and network)](#obj8)
* [Use shell scripting to automate system maintenance tasks](#obj9)

# Aggregated network links <a name="obj1"></a>

The full objective is: _Use network teaming or bonding to configure aggregated network links between two Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems_

[Official Red Hat Documentation][2]

Using VirtualBox, we can configure two machines to connect to each other with several network configurations. In this setup I'll be using a 'host-only network'. With two NICs in the VM they are named `enp0s3` and `enp0s8` which will be the "ports" which will be teamed.

    nmcli connection add type team ifname Team0
    nmcli connection add type team-slave con-name Team0-port1 ifname enp0s3 master Team0
    nmcli connection add type team-slave con-name Team0-port2 ifname enp0s8 master Team0
    nmcli connection up team-Team0

# Configure IPv6 addresses and perform basic IPv6 troubleshooting <a name="obj2"></a>

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3

# Route IP traffic and create static routes <a name="obj3"></a>

There is a section in the [documentation][3] on configuring static routed using the command line. The relevant man page to get information on configuring static routes will be `ip-route`.

    man ip-route

An important thing to note is how to make changes persistent:

>Static routes set using ip commands at the command prompt will be lost if the system is shutdown or restarted. To configure static routes to be persistent after a system restart, they must be placed in per-interface configuration files in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ directory.     

Generally we'll use the `ip` command to configure routes.

    ip route add 192.168.0.64/26 via 192.168.0.2

# Using firewalld <a name="obj4"></a>

The full objective is: _Use firewalld and associated mechanisms such as rich rules, zones and custom rules, to implement packet filtering and configure network address translation (NAT)_

The Fedora project has a great [document][6] on the subject of firewallD which I'll be following along with here.

Let's start with the most important command for an exam: where to get quick help:

    [root@firewall ~]# firewall-cmd -h

First, let's see what firewallD is up to:

    [root@firewall ~]# firewall-cmd --state
    running

firewallD uses zones to configure rules based on levels of trust, let's see what zones firewallD is working with:

    [root@firewall ~]# firewall-cmd --get-zones
    block dmz drop external home internal public trusted work

We can use the `--list-all-zones` command to get an overview of all the zones. In this example I'm only showing the config for the `block` zone but it shows you the type of things that are available for configuration for the zone.

    [root@firewall ~]# firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
    block
      interfaces: 
      sources: 
      services: 
      ports: 
      masquerade: no
      forward-ports: 
      icmp-blocks: 
      rich rules: 

So let's get down to some actual work. I'll set up apache and we'll work through getting it opened and available.

    [root@firewall ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
    success

That's it! Without specifying a zone, it will automatically use the default zone, in my case the `public` zone. We use the `--permanentt` option to make sure that the rules we set will be available after we reboot.

The fedoraproject site also has some [documentation][7] for information pertaining to 'rich rules'. Essentially 'rich rules' is a syntax that allows us to describe iptables rules in a structured sort of way.

    [root@firewall ~]# firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule protocol value='ah' accept'
    success

In this example we are adding a protocol rule which applies to the 'authentication header' protocol.

The scope of the rich rules syntax is a bit much to cover here but there is a man-page for it which provides several examples and is actually easy to use.

    [root@firewall ~]# man firewalld.richlanguage

As for NAT, SSN Network has a great [video][8] on youtube on the subject. In short you are going to either add an interface to the `external` zone where masquerading  is enabled by default or adding the `masquerade` option to a zone you would like to add NAT to.


# Use /proc/sys and sysctl to modify and set kernel runtime parameters <a name="obj5"></a>

We can use /proc/sys or /etc/sysctl.conf to make changes to the kernel runtime parameters. 

For example, if we `cat` out the contents of the `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` file we can see what forwarding for this system is set to `0` (off) or `1` (on).

We can change the value to what we want in this file or we can set it in the /etc/sysctl.conf file this way:

    net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

Notice that the name follows the directory structure within `/proc/sys`.

# Configure a system to authenticate using Kerberos <a name="obj6"></a>

You'll need the `authconfig` package which will give you the `authconfig-tui` program which makes configuring a system to use kerberos very, very easy.

    yum install -y krb5-workstation pam_krb5
    authconfig-tui
    domain PEQUENO.in
    kdc krb.pequeno.in
    admin krb.pequeno.in
    # kinit test1
    ssh test1@krb.pequeno.in

# Configure a system as either an iSCSI target or initiator <a name="obj7"></a>

The full objective is: _Configure a system as either an iSCSI target or initiator that persistently mounts an iSCSI target_

In the version of this exam for RHEL 6 the objective was to configure an iscsi initiator but in this version it seems like you should be able to do both. The good news is that configuring an iscsi target is actually easier since we now use a tool from Datera called `targetcli`. I'll be following this [guide][5].

    yum -y install targetcli 



# Produce and deliver reports on system utilization (processor, memory, disk, and network) <a name="obj8"></a>

I think the idea here is to get familiar with the `sar` command to generate reports on system utilization. A very quick way to cover all your bases is to get `sar` to give you everything (`-A`) and dump it into a file:

    [root@sysconfig #] sar -A > system-info.txt

Generally, get familiar with `sar`s flags. How you produce reports and what you report on will depend on how they ask the question on the exam.

In Michael Jang's [book][4] he also suggests to use `sadf` to produce reports. `sadf` works similarly to `sar` but it produces output in CSV so they can be easily imported into other data analysis tools. 

# Use shell scripting to automate system maintenance tasks <a name="obj9"></a>

Again, how you solve this problem depends on exactly what they ask you to do on the exam. But let's make up a scenario that will demonstrate how we'd be able to do some common administration tasks with some scripts.

cron generate a bunch of files then clear them out maybe random size, remove if larger than some value
update the welcome message based on time of day
clear out the contents of home folders
